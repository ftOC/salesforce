    <subject>REMINDER:  SingleCRM Planned Outage June 9</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear singleCRM users,

As part of the CO7 automation initiative, we are building additional partner capabilities in our Salesforce ecosystem with the inclusion of new Partner Relationship Management (PRM) system. This will allow the Channel Partners to learn and understand market directions, have a single consistent experience to engage with Nokia, and increase self-sufficiency in transacting business with us.

In the first release, ten Partners supporting Nokia ION and FN businesses have been selected to participate in a pilot, which will build the foundation for a new Partner Portal with Dynamic Views, Click to Accept Onboarding for New Partner Accounts and build a Partner database.

As we move closer to the first release go live, 12th of June 2017, we need to update the new Salesforce platform with the latest software.
Deployment activities begin with a singleCRM system outage at:
Friday, 9th of June, 8:00AM CET until Sunday, 11th of June 18.00 CET
During this time, you will not be able to access the singleCRM platform. In case you have any questions or issues, please reach out to your designated Key Users.

Thanks for your continued engagement and support.
Best regards,
singleCRM team</textOnly>
