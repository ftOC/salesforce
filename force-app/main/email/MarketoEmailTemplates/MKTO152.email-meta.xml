Enter the era of intelligent access
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Thank you for coming to see us at Broadband World Forum 2017. We really enjoyed the show and we trust you had a rewarding visit too!
We were really pleased with the reaction to intelligent access, our vision for a new era of fixed broadband networks that are faster, better and smarter.
Hopefully you got a good understanding of how intelligent access can help you achieve your goals. Check out our website for more inspiration and a wealth of materials to help you plan your network’s future.

And, of course, we’d love to continue the conversation. Don’t hesitate to contact your local Nokia sales representative, or simply reply to this email and we’ll get in touch.


Best wishes,

Nokia
