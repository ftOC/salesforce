European Utility Week (EUW)
3-5 October, 2017
RAI, Amsterdam, Netherlands
If you’re ready to discover the most advanced solutions to your most pressing communications challenges, Nokia booth 1L22 is the place to be! 

At the event, we’ll explore:



	- New FAN requirements and options

	- The benefits of private LTE networks—and a tool to quantify its financial impact 

	- Live MPLS network capabilities for converged communications modernization to support teleprotection, SCADA, and more

	- How to secure critical networks to meet and exceed compliance requirements through a new security management solution spanning multi-vendor IT and OT

	- A new digital assistant for field personnel communications troubleshooting and professional services offerings to simplify operations



Plus, attend our seminar
Register for a private LTE network and cyber security seminar on Tuesday, 3 October, 17.30 – 19.00, where we’ll cover two topics:



	- Private LTE networks: Find out about the private LTE network solution a utility builds and owns, initial use cases that US utilities identified for their deployments, planning activities, and a tool to quantify its financial impact.

	- Cyber security solutions for critical networks: Learn how you can effectively account for elements of logical security that meet and exceed current compliance requirements, within a multi-vendor IT and OT environment.



RSVP to Mari Holmstrom &lt;[[mailto:mari.holmstrom@nokia.com]]&gt; by 8 September. Join your peers at a reception after this seminar which is solely for utility personnel.
