Switch to Passive Optical LAN to cut costs and boost performance
Organizations around the world are switching from old Ethernet-over-copper LANs to new Passive Optical LAN. The Nokia Passive Optical LAN solution uses fiber technology – the same that powers the internet – to deliver a host of benefits.



	- Cost. Passive Optical LAN is up to 50% cheaper to install and operate than a traditional copper-based LAN.

	- Performance. Passive Optical LAN delivers up to 1 Gb/s to every user and has potentially unlimited scalability.

	- Security. Copper is much easier to hack than fiber. Nokia Passive Optical LAN provides military-grade security.



But there’s more. Passive Optical LAN also consumes less power, frees up office space, and is easier to operate and maintain. Learn how POL has helped other organizations and can help yours, too.
