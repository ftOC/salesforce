Addressing the 3 biggest SCADA migration challenges
Ensure your successful transition
As TDM-based networks are being phased out, mission-critical SCADA systems will migrate to packet-based networks like IP/MPLS. This brings three major challenges :

	- How to transport and bridge SCADA traffic
	- How to protect your system from cyber attacks
