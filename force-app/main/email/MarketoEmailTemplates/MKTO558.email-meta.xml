SUCCESSFUL security cloud implementations point to significant savings
Hello Sir/Madam,

Leverage lessons learned along the way to a successful security cloud and reduce the challenges of the architecture development process.

Read the use case “Security cloud for financial services &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XT_Security.Cloud.Financial.LP.html?did=d000000000an&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 10b-securitycloudforfinancialservicesusecase&amp;utm_term=finance]]&gt;” to learn how the Nokia overlay cloud solution has been successfully applied across multiple implementations. The use case reveals how you can:



	- Provide security and compliance
	- Evolve in sync with the fastest moving environment
	- Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by at least 25 percent for your large enterprise cloud environment!


I hope that you enjoy this use case!
