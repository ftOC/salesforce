Operators worldwide are looking at the unlicensed spectrum as a way to expand capacity and augment service offerings in strategic locations. Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) and LTE-WLAN Radio Aggregation (LWA) make it easier and affordable to use unlicensed spectrum with small cells. With LTE as the baseline layer, these new radio access technologies enable efficient and reliable use of unlicensed spectrum in ultra-dense small cell deployments.

Creating ultra-dense urban networks with available spectrum
Discover how to leverage licensed and unlicensed spectrum, and site density solutions, such as small cells, to create ultra-dense networks in your market.
