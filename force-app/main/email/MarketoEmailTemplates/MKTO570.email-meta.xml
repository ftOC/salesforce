OpenStack private cloud – the right solution for the banking industry
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Does a private cloud make sense? That’s the question many large enterprises are asking. For the banking industry, the answer to that question is definitely - yes!

 Read our case study, “Centuries Young Bank readies for another century of progress &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/8227.centuries.old.bank.V2.html?did=d000000000ah&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 4b-bankingcasestudy&amp;utm_term=finance]]&gt;,” for details on how an OpenStack private cloud met the challenges of the banking industry and changed the game for this large multinational bank.

I hope that you enjoy this case study!
