When every second counts…. building mission-critical communications for airports
Be our guest at 13th ACI Asia-Pacific Regional Assembly
Tokyo Bay Makuhari Hall, Narita, Japan 23 - 25 April 2018


Today’s airports handle millions of passengers each year while housing thousands of employees, from air traffic control to customs to concessions. To serve the continued growth in air traffic, airports must meet the highest standards of safety and security. At the same time airports must also ensure financial stability by reducing costs, increasing non-aeronautical revenue and ensuring their operational efficiency is being further improved through new advancements in technology.

Nokia experts will be at Booth #32 to discuss any topics that you are interested in and demonstrate our latest innovative products, solutions and services. Nokia is your trusted partner in ensuring the mission-critical communication system foundation for a smart, connected airport.
