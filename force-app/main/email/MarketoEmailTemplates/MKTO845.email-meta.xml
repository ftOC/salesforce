Partners,

 Wavence is the evolution and the new name for the Nokia 9500 Microwave Packet radio portfolio. Despite this name change, your customers will still be able to rely on this solution to prepare their microwave transport for high capacity throughput and carrier grade reliability.

How will your customers benefit with Wavence?
 Traditional microwave networks are under pressure to support the growing adoption of packet-based 
applications and services. Voice demand is shifting to data demand as mobile subscribers surf the Internet, download apps and consume mobile video. Enterprise services are evolving to IP and must support higher-bandwidth applications, including video. To respond, your customers need cost-effective and reliable solutions that maximize radio link performance, support advanced packet networking and simplify operations. Wavence delivers on each of these.

 What’s new with Wavence R18?
 The update from 9500 MPR R.7.1 to Nokia Wavence R18 is addressing the needs of all customers for several aspects mainly related to a more intelligent way to manage networks.



	- Info related to real capacity carried by a link to routers connected to Wavence MPT
	- Upgrade for the installed MSS-1 base and green field for cost effective solution with medium capacity
	- Introduction of Nokia strategy for SDN
	- Simplified operational management for nodes without installing a dedicated application on PC
	- Release of new Wavence MSS-4 10G shelf – 10G in 1 Rack Unit
	- New Higher Power Transceivers for NAM: MPT-HLC Plus (ANSI only) with 4k QAM


As with previous 9500 MPR releases, the new Wavence R18 for partners will contain simple Wavence MPT and MSS products. The Wavence MPT-HL (Long Haul), Wavence UBT and OEM products can be made available on dedicated partner request. Finally, as part of this new release, 9500 MPR R6.1 will be discontinued.

To learn more, explore a customer testimonial where one of Germany’s largest public safety agencies selected the Nokia Wavence solution for packet-based backhauling reliability and readiness to enhanced data, IP video and broadband services.
