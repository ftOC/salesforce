Introducing the world’s first multi-terabit network processor
On June 14, 2017, something incredible happened.

Nokia launched the FP4, a new 2.4 Tbps network processers unit for Nokia’s 7750 and 7950 router portfolios. The FP4-enabled 7750 and 7950 routers address the unique needs of two markets – communications service providers and internet content providers.

Up until now vendors have been faced with the challenge of meeting the needs of a split market, but that’s over now. Get the full story, including why BT has provided a resounding endorsement for FP4.
