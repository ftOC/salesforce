Experts answer questions on innovation and the future of IP networking
On June 14, 2017, Nokia launched some exciting innovations in IP networking technology – including the FP4 – the world’s first multi-terabit network processor for Nokia’s 7750 and 7950 router portfolios.

The event featured industry experts, Basil Alwan, President, IP/Optical Networks Business Group at Nokia, and Neil McRae, Managing Director and Chief Architect at BT.

And because breakthroughs of this magnitude don’t happen every day, the event concluded with an interactive Q&amp;A session focusing on IP networking innovation, the Nokia portfolio and real-world applications for technology,
