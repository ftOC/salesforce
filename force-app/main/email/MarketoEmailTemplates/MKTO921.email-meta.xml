Nokia CSD Data Sheet
Discover how to simplify, scale and secure your network
As your mobile network’s usage continues to grow rapidly, the challenge becomes how to effectively manage control traffic. With ubiquitous access to personal multimedia devices, subscribers are driving the next generation of network capabilities, resulting in a huge rise in control traffic.

 Deploying a 4G LTE network without a signaling solution creates a complicated control topology and an inefficient signaling control plane, which increases maintenance and operations costs and can cause service degradation and outages.

 In this data sheet, learn how Nokia Cloud Signaling Director (CSD) can insert an intelligent routing entity into your network core’s control plane, resulting in a simpler, more scalable and more secure control topology.
Enjoy!
