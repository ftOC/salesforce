Hello, {{Lead.First Name}},
 
 Here is your white paper: Migrating enterprise session border controllers to the cloud.

An email has also been sent to the address you provided so that you can access this report from anywhere.



The Nokia Session Border Controller (SBC) protects the network against threats, and guarantees quality of experience for a wide 
variety of voice and video traffic types – whether that traffic comes from employee devices within the enterprise or via interconnect interfaces to partners, suppliers, and customers.

Our SBC can reduce costs, improve your customers’ experience, and protect your business from threats. It also accelerates innovation by providing an in-built WebRTC gateway. A recognized world leader in SBC technology, Nokia provides all this in a single SBC software load that can be deployed on a hardware appliance, fully virtualized in the cloud, or as a hybrid mix of the two.
