Hello Sir/Madam,

Get the DevOps cloud you really need by leveraging what others have learned along the way.

Read the use case “DevOps cloud for large enterprises &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XT_DevOps.Cloud.LargeEnterprise.LP.html?did=d000000000ay&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 8a-devopscloudforLEusecase&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt;” to learn how the Nokia overlay cloud solution has been successfully applied across multiple implementations. The use case reveals how you can:



	- Upgrade your large enterprise environment into a leading-edge DevOps cloud
	- Provide a rich and globally consistent user experience
	- Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by at least 25 percent!


I hope that you enjoy this use case!
