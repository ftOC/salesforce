Miercom Report
Guess who set benchmarks in performance testing?
The results are in. After completing independent performance and function validation testing, the cloud-based Nokia Session Border Controller (SBC) has earned the prestigious Miercom Performance Certified certification – setting the benchmark for performance and security in fixed, cable and mobile networks.

 In this Miercom report, take a deeper dive into the findings, including how Nokia SBC has demonstrated:


	- Complete mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks without degradation in performance
	- High resiliency in failover tests with 100% successful handover of established calls
	- Highest per-VNF capacity for software-based media and signaling
Enjoy!
