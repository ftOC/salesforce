Diane Myers - Architecting for secure service enablement
Facing rapid industry change, network engineers need to work hard to keep ahead of growing requirements. With the move to IMS architectures, service providers now have a unique opportunity to add the capacity and new services they need, while remaining agile to prepare future evolution.

 The IHS Markit report, written by Diane Myers, reveals findings on:



	- Key market and technology trends for IMS and IP-based services
	- The architecture required for service enablement
	- The components for enabling secure, reliable, high-performing services
Enjoy!
