Download: A breakthrough in silicon innovation
A massive leap in network processor silicon for high-performance routing
The onslaught of connected devices driven by smart homes, grids and cities as well as the availability of staggering bandwidth on the path to 5G and the Internet of Things will drive new and enriched experiences. To deliver these rich experiences and keep pace with evolving trends, network operators will have to reimagine their IP networking infrastructures.

Intelligent IP routers powered by leading-edge IP routing silicon will be the foundation of modern IP networks.

Nokia is paving the way to the future with innovative technology, including the FP4 – the industry’s first multi-terabit network processor silicon.

In this paper, learn about the FP4 breakthrough and:


	- The current IP networking landscape
	- Design requirements for modern IP networks
	- The capabilities, features and benefits of FP4 silicon
