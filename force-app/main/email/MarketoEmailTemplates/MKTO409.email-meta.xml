Thank you for visiting Nokia at FIC 2018
It was a pleasure to meet and talk with you about cybersecurity challenges and show you some of our latest innovations.

 This year, Nokia presented solutions that:


	- Protect mission-critical networks from quantum computing attacks
	- Secure sensors and traffic from IoT-based services
	- Use SDN technology to automate network security


We hope they captured your interest. Our sales representative is at your disposal if you need more information.

 We are also pleased to share with you our latest white paper &lt;[[https://resources.nokia.com/asset/201836]]&gt; about cybersecuring mission-critical networks.
