Defining fabric of the digital airport
Booth 1638 Nashville Music Center, TN, USA
 30 September – 2 October 2018
Today’s airports handle millions of passengers each year while housing thousands of employees – from air traffic control, to customs, to concessions. To serve their needs, airports must meet not only the highest standards of safety but also compete financially by reducing OpEx and attracting new passengers with enhanced broadband services.

 At Nokia, we understand how to build reliable networks, keep them secure, and use them to help airports solve critical problems. Nokia experts will be at booth #1638 to discuss specific topics and demonstrate our latest innovative products, solutions and services:
Enhance operational reliability and improve passenger experience


	- We will showcase how private LTE CBRS wireless services will benefit airport operations and further improve the passenger experience


Understanding the defining fabric of the digital airport


	- We will show Nokia airport solutions that feature ultra-reliable services, cyber security protection, monetization opportunities, cost reductions, reduced carbon footprint and improved passenger experience


Gain operations intelligence with analytics


	- We will show how Nokia IoT applications break down siloed data and use advanced analytics to solve specific operational and maintenance pain points in airport operations, assets, and infrastructure
