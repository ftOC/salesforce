Enterprise Connect 2018
Nokia is attending Enterprise Connect 2018 in Orlando. Will you be there?

For enterprise networks that rely on IP voice and video, the session border controller (SBC) plays a critical but sometimes challenging role. Whether your company is struggling with deploying innovative IP communication services, trying to protect against DDoS attacks, or transitioning from your legacy UC or SBC to the cloud, Nokia can help you with our award-winning, cloud-native SBC.

 Visit the Enterprise Connect Nokia booth (#207) and discover a field-proven, cloud-native SBC that can maximize your operational 
efficiency and security without impacting the performance, all while improving your customers’ experience.

To ensure you have time with our experts to discuss SBC and watch the demos, pre-book a meeting with our team. 

Request a meeting &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XL-EC-Invitation.html]]&gt; by clicking the button below and complete the short form. One of our experts will be in touch with you to set up a time and answer any questions you have.
