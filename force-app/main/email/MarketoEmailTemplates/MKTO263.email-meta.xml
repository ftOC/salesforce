Public Safety
Fictional storyline by Nokia

Drones find missing Ecuadorian hikers

Two hikers that went missing in Pañacocha last weekend have been found. A rescue helicopter transported the hikers to a nearby hospital last night as a precaution, although the couple seemed to be in good condition. 

Ecuador’s national search and rescue team was able to locate the missing hikers thanks to drones equipped with cameras and thermal sensors. The drones were part of a trial related to the government’s mobile broadband network, newly set up with Nokia.
