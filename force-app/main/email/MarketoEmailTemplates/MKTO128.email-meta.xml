Rethinking IT infrastructure for digital health
The healthcare industry is moving to a digital health model to control costs, increase access, and improve patient care.

Healthcare IT organizations must lead this move by rethinking their systems, infrastructure, and service offers. To succeed, they need to:



	- Build and implement a next-generation digital infrastructure

	- Modernize existing infrastructure to address changing business needs

	- Adopt emerging technologies that can unlock new business opportunities

	- Choose the right cloud model – private, public or hybrid


Read our whitepaper, “Transforming healthcare IT &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/1283.TransformingHealthcareIT_LandingPage.html]]&gt;,” to learn how to build an IT infrastructure that provides the speed, agility and security you need to deliver next-generation patient care.
Sincerely,
