Public Safety
Fictional storyline by Nokia

Mobile broadband took center stage at public safety conference

The Ecuadorian Ministry of Interior organized its first international public safety conference in Quito last week. The conference brought together nearly 300 public safety experts from around the world to discuss the possibilities of mobile broadband for public safety. 

Ecuador is an active member of the Mission Critical Communication Association, set up by Nokia and other public safety network operators to increase innovation in the field by facilitating multinational collaboration and best practices sharing.
