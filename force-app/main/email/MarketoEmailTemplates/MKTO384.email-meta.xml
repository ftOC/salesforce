Report by Diane Myers on secure service enablement
With rapid growth in the communications industry, service providers need an effective, cost-efficient strategy to stay ahead of growing requirements. With the move to IMS architectures, operators now have a unique opportunity to add capacity, increase revenue through new services, and increase agility to prepare for future evolution.

 The IHS Markit report, written by Diane Myers, reveals findings on: 



	- Key market and technology trends for IMS and IP-based services
	- The architecture required for service enablement
	- The components for enabling secure, reliable, high-performing services
Enjoy!
