Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

The phenomenal increase in OpenStack adoption proves its value for enterprises. Yet, one key issue is often encountered by large enterprises — driving large-scale cloud networks from OpenStack.

 This TechTarget white paper &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/2393.Taking.OpenStack.Into.Production.V2.html?did=d000000000ax&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 7a-takingopenstacktolargeWP&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt; discusses the challenges of managing large networks as part of an OpenStack private cloud. It also examines ways in which the challenges can be overcome with the right OpenStack configuration and complementary products. Download your free copy today!

I hope that you enjoy this white paper.
