Nokia SBC Sets Benchmarks in Performance Testing
When choosing an SBC, you need a partner and a product that you can trust to deliver high-quality results.

After completing independent performance and function validation testing, Miercom has awarded the cloud-based Nokia SBC with the prestigious Miercom Performance Certified certification, where it set the benchmark for performance and security in fixed, cable and mobile networks.

Key findings from Miercom’s testing report include:


	- Complete mitigation of DDoS attacks without degradation in performance

	- High resiliency in failover tests with 100% successful handover of established calls
	- Highest per-VNF capacity for software-based media and signaling
Enjoy!
