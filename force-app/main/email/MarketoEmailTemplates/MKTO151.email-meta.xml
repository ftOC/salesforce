Meet the world’s first multi-terabit processor
The FP4: Designed to expect the unexpected
The cloud, 5G, the Internet of Things. Whatever the future holds, it pays to be ready. 

 That’s why we created the FP4 – a new 2.4Tbps network processer unit that’s designed to power the world’s biggest and most powerful IP routers. 

 Nokia’s breakthrough FP4 silicon innovation and proven high-performance routing software drives the 7750 SR-s series routers. With the FP4 inside, service providers and webscale operators can prepare for the future by building much bigger, safer and more adaptive networks without compromise. And that’s just good news for the world.

 Discover the FP4 and reimagine IP networking in this video.
