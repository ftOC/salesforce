Smart building connectivity that frees space, costs and energy
Space is at a premium in all your properties. Every saving increases value for your customers and gives you more options in your building designs. 

Passive Optical LAN is a new local area network technology that saves space in smart buildings. It uses light over fiber optic cable to transmit data – the same technology that drives the Internet. 

Compared to a traditional copper-based local area network, it requires a lot less equipment, meaning valuable floorspace isn’t wasted on equipment closets. What’s more, fiber optic cabling is much lighter, tougher and more flexible than copper cabling, enabling lighter building loads and better use of ducts. Finally, it’s also much quicker and easier to install, saving valuable construction or refurbishment time. 

On our new website, you will find all the benefits of Passive Optical LAN to decide if it is right for your properties. (Spoiler alert: it is).
