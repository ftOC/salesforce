Building a private network for real-time healthcare
Real-time healthcare requires an aware and adaptive technology infrastructure that senses, directs, and changes as needed. As a healthcare provider moving to a real-time care and cloud-based IT model, you need more flexible and agile networks.

Read our white paper, &quot;Building a private network for real-time healthcare and the cloud &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/18483.Bldg-a-private-network-for-real-time-Healthcare.html]]&gt;&quot; and learn how you can connect multiple sites and data centers to create a secure private cloud for critical healthcare workflow and applications.
Sincerely,

Cindy Bergevin
 Head of Healthcare Marketing, Nokia
