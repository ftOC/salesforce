Smart building connectivity that frees space, costs and energy
Connectivity, especially high-speed broadband, is high on the priority list for your customers. A new generation of in-building local area network technology called Passive Optical LAN can give your developments an edge, while reducing costs for you and your customers. 

Passive Optical LAN uses fiber optic cable instead of copper and the same technology that delivers gigabit broadband speeds to millions of users worldwide. It outperforms a traditional copper-based Ethernet LAN everywhere you look: 



	- Faster and cheaper to install: up to 50% lower CAPEX. 

	- Gigabit broadband speeds to every connection. 

	- Lighter cabling and less equipment liberates valuable space. 

	- Meet green energy regulations and building codes. 

	- Fiber will easily last 50+ years without needing any upgrades. 



Wherever you are in your development plans, Nokia Passive Optical LAN can improve them. Visit our website to learn more.
