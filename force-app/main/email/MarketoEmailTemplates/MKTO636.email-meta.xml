Use cases based on multiple SUCCESSFUL cloud implementations
Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Avoid the pitfalls associated with developing a new cloud architecture yourself and leverage what others have learned along the way. 

Read the use case “Public-private cloud for large enterprises &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XT_Hybrid.Cloud.LargeEnterprise.LP.html?did=d000000000aw&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 6a-hybridcloudforleusecase&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt;” to learn how the Nokia overlay cloud solution has been successfully applied across multiple implementations. You’ll discover how you can:
 

 	- Upgrade your large enterprise environment into a private cloud without needing a forklif 	- Provide access to public cloud as part of a hybrid cloud approach 	- Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by at least 25 percent! 

 
I hope that you enjoy this use case!
