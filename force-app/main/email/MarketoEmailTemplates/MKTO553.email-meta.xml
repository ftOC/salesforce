The following Associated Documents with planned updates include:



 - Partner Program Rules
 - Partner Pricing Rules
 - Partner Maintenance Conditions
 - Partner Deal Registration and Deal Origination Discount Program Rules
 - Co-op Program Rules

These Associated Documents will be made available for early preview on the Nokia Partner Portal &gt; Topic Catalogue &gt; Partner Programs &gt; Support Assets on 1 May 2018 and will become effective on 1 June 2018. 

On this effective date, these updated Associated Documents will supersede all previous versions.
