Planned updates to the Global Partner Program and the Associated Documents as part of your Nokia Partner Program Agreement - Distribution
May 1, 2018

Dear Partner,

Nokia has made updates to the Associated Documents which are an integral part of your Partner Program Agreement (PPA-DIS).

We have updated the following Associated Documents:



	- Program Rules for Distributors
	- Program Rules for Indirect Resellers
	- Pricing Rules for Distributors
	- Maintenance Conditions for Distributors
	- Deal Registration and Deal Origination Discount Rules for Distributors
	- Co-op Program Rules
	- Glossary of Program Terms for Distributors



Please note that your existing Partner Program Agreement - Distribution does not change, only the Associated Documents listed above that govern the Global Partner Program. 

These Associated Documents will be made available for preview on the Nokia Partner Portal &gt; Topic Catalogue &gt; Distributor Programs &gt; Support Assets on May 1, 2018 and will become effective on June 1, 2018. 

On June 1, these updated Associated Documents will supersede all previous versions. 

As a reminder “Nokia Indirect Reseller Application” (NIRA) is now available. The NIRA replaces the previously used Indirect Reseller Charter, and allows Indirect Resellers to register directly to the Nokia Global Partner Program. Please direct all Indirect Resellers that are new or had not previously completed the Indirect Reseller Charter to complete the NIRA here &lt;[[https://networks.nokia.com/indirect-reseller-application]]&gt;.

For your information, please find attached hereto a summary of the most important planned changes to these Associated Documents as well as more 
information about the NIRA.

If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact your Nokia Partner Sales Manager.


Todd Roth 
Senior Director, Nokia Global Partner Program

ABOUT THE Nokia Indirect Reseller Agreement (“NIRA”)

The NIRA tool replaces the previous Indirect Reseller Charter contractually required in versions 02_02 or earlier of the Nokia PPA-DIS. 

Using this new web based application tool allows Nokia to rapidly approve and allow Indirect Reseller’s access to the Partner Portal, where Global Partner Program resources, training and certification courses are available. 

If your partners previously signed an Indirect Reseller Charter, they will need to submit a NIRA to continue to access the Partner Portal. Your Nokia Partner Sales Manager will be in contact with you regarding the transition timeline to enroll your existing Indirect Resellers via the NIRA. 

As part of the NIRA process, Indirect Resellers are required to accept Nokia Indirect Reseller Agreement that regulates their participation in Nokia Global Partner Program and is connected to their adherence to Program Rules for Indirect Resellers. The text of the Nokia Indirect Reseller Agreement is available on the following link: https://networks.nokia.com/indirect-reseller-application &lt;[[https://networks.nokia.com/indirect-reseller-application]]&gt;
