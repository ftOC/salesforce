Your opinion of Nokia
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=First name}}, 

We’re emailing to let you know about a short survey that Nokia would like to invite you to take part in. In return for your participation, a donation of $30 (or the equivalent in local currency) will be made to a charity that you will be able to select upon completion of the survey.

We are interested to understand your opinion of our cable operator products and services and how you think we might improve them. The survey will include questions about Nokia and other brands so you’ll be able to provide feedback on the industry as a whole.

The survey will be conducted by an independent third party and should take around 10 minutes. All opinions you offer will remain anonymous and confidential. The results will be used, in aggregate, to improve Nokia’s products and services and the way we work with our customers overall. 

Next week you will receive a message from Nokia@Intellisurvey.com with the subject line ‘Nokia invites you to share your opinion’ and a link to participate in the survey.


Thank you in advance for your participation. We value your opinion.
