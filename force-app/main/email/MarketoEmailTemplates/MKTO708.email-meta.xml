Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Understanding your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) can change the game for enterprises considering an OpenStack private cloud migration.

To ensure you have full visibility of all costs, we would like to provide a free cost analysis of your environment. This special offer is only available until June 30, 2018.

To take advantage of this limited time offer, contact your Nokia account representative, or channel partner. If contact information is unavailable, just click the ‘Contact us &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/C0004O-ContactUs.html?did=d000000000b4&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 14a-tcooffer&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt;’ button and we’ll be happy to get back to you. 

I look forward to hearing from you!
