SADM will provide the IP/MPLS Agent with a seed file containing a list of UE Relay IP addresses to be managed. IP/MPLS Agent will use this file rather than the current User Interface to discover the UE RelaysInventory data collection and export: The IP/MPLS Agent will collect Inventory data from the UE Relays. The inventory data will be available for export using the same format as the NetAct XML Based Inventory Data Export interfaceUE Relay as a new managed object type in the IP/MPLS Agent model to enable alarm and performance data mapping to the correct objects including Ethernet and Radio portsSecurity enhancements: The IP/MPLS Agent will be enhanced with Agent User Management. This will enable users to access the agent with different roles including administrators with full read/write access and viewers that will have read only access. Additional security enhancements will include encryption of data including the RMI interface from the agent web user interface (Web UI) plus hardening of logs and

the error messages given in fatal situations rarely give any hint of the root cause but can be even more misleading than helpful. The problem in general is that when connections are made DeFra does not have anymore control. For http is has, but not for JMS and IIOP. Secondly, there is no nice way to get from IBM client the cause of the connection failure (except relying on IBM's exception causes :D), so that we could do some kind of aspect or interceptor in between to give some meaningful message or supress them. There are solutions, but perhaps there is no nice ones with currrent OES architecture. The problem lies there that OES provides direct EJB interfaces instead of nice clean java POJO interfaces, which could be easilly for example proxied and therefore they would be more in control.

issue in alarm polling from MOFD.    As part of the pronto , MOFD and MOFC corrected the codes. Usage of  DatabaseUtilities.getDatabaseUTCTime() in MOFD for alarm polling is removed and replaced with System.getCurrentTimeInM...()  API since the value what it returned was in correct. These changes are done in OES2.1 and PSI4 branches as part  PR NA04878367.    To give more accuracy(in case if the machine/PC clock setting of the server and MOFD Client have different values), MOFD should retrieve the UTC time stamp from server . For this , the above said DEFRA API should go for correction. This is required only in trunk (PSI5) .Once the correct version is available, MOFD would revert back the System.getCurrentTimeInM...()   usage to DatabaseUtilities.getDatabaseUTCTime(). No changes are required from DEFRA for OES2.1 and PSI4 branches with respect to DatabaseUtilities.getDatabaseUTCTime().   What would be the impact if we would not provide the fix in  a) PSI5             lose in accuracy in polling which will happen very rarely  b) never                  Same as above.  Just one technical doubt: When changing the functionality of the DEFRA DatabaseUtilities.getDatabaseUTCTime() method, would it affect other places? E.g. how is alarm polling from FX_ALARM done, does it use the same method?   We observed in our analysis of the alarm state change polling that certain functionality could only work in the past because two erroneous implementations complemented each other such that the combination of these errors gave a correct result.","Originated":"2015-08-25T13:27:27Z","Owner":null,"Policy":"NSN Feature","Type":"Feature","Vault":"eService Production","PDMModified":"2017-04-27T13:51:37Z","AlternateCode":null,"AlternateCode2":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2017-05-24T13:10:49Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-14T02:16:03.67Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"ItemType":"Feature","FeatureItemId":"0000000682_","ItemId":null,"Description":"Defra: User specific options","Lastupdate":"2017-04-27T18:10:17Z","LifeCycleStatus":"FS4 Approved","Name":"0000000682","NSNAdditionalInformation":null,"NSNClassification":"Feature Component","NSNFocalPointId":"OSS_FC_003855","NSNLegacyFeatureId":null,"NSNLegacyNcmCode":null,"NSNLegacyRevision":null,"NSNLicenced":"FALSE","NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNSummary":"Defra provides the framework to manage user specific options of the applications.

downloads the SW into cluster to be upgraded.That leads to full local upgrade procedure, although the procedure after HW changes, with pre- and post-checks, could be run remotely from GSD.Splitting the SW into smaller entities makes it possible to interrupt the download, and redo parts of it in transfer problem cases.There will be another requirement to have another type of media drive as part

P-GW should try N times(configurable) with a time interval (T-interval, configurable) between two retry.

System solution developed by Nokia for indoor applications.eDAS supports triple bands 2T2R on 700MHz (3GPP B28) and 800MHz (3GPP B18) and 2.1GHz (3GPP B1). Additionally eDAS provides Ethernet transport layer for Nokia Small Cells thus 2.6GHz/3.5GHz TDD Small Cells (AiO) can be supported.Key features of eDAS:- Lower indoor distributed antenna system deployment cost by utilization of Nokia CPRI Interface: MU (Main Unit) supports the Nokia-based CPRI interface for connecting Nokia BBU directly to indoor distributed antenna system without the need of RRH installation.- Hybrid solution combining Small Cell for high traffic area: Ethernet data forwarding capability provides the backhaul interface at each RU for supporting TD-LTE small cell sites.- High Capacity and Configurable sector splitting functionality: eDAS can support multi sectors and multi bands and those BBU resources are configurable to be assigned to each HU (Hub-Unit).- Flexible indoor area coverage Topology of eDAS is Double-Star Configuration. eDAS supports maximum 64 RUs (Remote Units) i.e. 1 MU x 8 HU x 8 RU/per HU = 64 RUs per eDAS system.This LTE2979 feature
