The statistical nature of the traffic patterns makes it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50 resources.  This is a value add for Nokia customers especially if they are able to provision/control the oversubscription rate based on their subscriber intake rate and proportion of business to residential users.

It offershigh throughput, full-duplex and error-free communications for asynchronoususers as well as synchronous rates formainframe applications.L FAX facilityIt provides full-duplex data trans-mission rates from low (300 bit/s) tohigh speeds (33 600 bit/s) thus offeringall major data rates for dial-up modems.The modem also supports send and re-ceive fax operation.In point-to-point leased line appli-cations both 2-wire and 4-wire leasedline connections are feasible. The ECMFAST 28800?s automatic dial back-upfeatures ensure continuous datatransmission on a dial-up line in case theleased line connection fails. When theline quality is sufficient, the modemautomatically returns back to the leasedline.ApplicationsThe ECM FAST 28800 is a viable solutionfor both public and private modem pools.In public modem pools it is especiallyeffective, since it enables the operator touse only one modem type to cover allsubscriber needs. In private modem poolsthe ECM FAST 28800 offers a fast andreliable way of accessing host computersand LANs. The ECM FAST 28800 can beused as a synchronous link up to 33 600bit/s data rate for mainframe andMultiplexer applications.ECM FAST 28800Dial-up and Leased Line Modems.?

It is logically part of the MGW user plane but it is a separated network element that is connected to the MGW.The CDS supports both the Integrated and the Stand Alone MSC Server concept. In the MSS concept where only signalling is conveyed to MSS and both TDM and packet based user plane is transported via MGW, the CDS provides the IWF functionality for the CS data calls.The functions of the CDS depend on the services and the type of fixed network. The CDS is required to convert the protocols used in the PLMN to those used in the appropriate fixed network. The CDS is not used when the service implementation in the PLMN is directly compatible with that at the fixed network (e.g. 56/64 kbit/s transparent data services). To optimise the operator's IWF usage the CDS can be shared by several MGWs, which means that the operator does not need to aquire IWF resources to each MGW even though the access points for CS data calls are in different MGWs.","LastUpdate":"2017-07-12T12:39:06Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-3G Core","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P250673.01","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-000586","NSNPartner":null,"NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Koskela Erkki","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2002-09-30T17:23:36Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2002-09-30T17:23:36Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2002-09-30T17:23:36Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2003-08-26T13:00:08Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2004-09-28T09:10:13Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2008-10-08T08:47:09Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2008-10-08T08:47:18Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2008-10-08T08:53:35Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2008-10-08T08:53:59Z","Obsolete":"2008-10-08T08:54:07Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-000588_","ReleaseStatus":"Active","Lifecyclestatus":"C7 End Of Marketing","Description":"BG and FW 2","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-000588","NSNLegacyRevision":null,"NSNSummary":"The new feature of BG and FW 2 release is more capasity for Ipsec VPN.

Test loops can be started manually with the front panel controls or automatically using the ITU-T speci-fiedinterface signals.Automatic Data Rate AdaptationAutomatic data rate adaptation provides the possibility to adjust theline speed according to? the DTE clock rate at the master modem? the incoming line rate at the slave modemThe automatic data rate controlling minimizes the need for installation personnel on modem sites.Technical H","LastUpdate":"2017-07-10T12:33:18Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-Mature Products","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P256752.01","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-000799","NSNPartner":null,"NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Rantanen Lippo","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2005-11-16T12:21:06Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2005-11-16T12:21:13Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2005-11-16T12:21:18Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2005-11-16T12:21:24Z","Obsolete":"2017-01-12T02:48:23Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-000801_","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"D50e R9.0","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-000801","NSNLegacyRevision":null,"NSNSummary":"D50e R9.0 is planned to support the following features in addition to previous releases:eDMT8a3 (without Low Pass POTS Filter)An 8-port ADSL line card using DMT technology supporting T1.413i2, G.992.1 and G.992.2, Annex A, on a port-by-port basis with G.HS.

This card supports broadband AAL5/ATM segmentation, reassembly of ATM cells, and the PPPoE scheme both RFC 1483 bridged and routed, with VLAN?s (Virtual Local Area Network).  The MLA will support VLAN for LAN interconnecting or leased line customers per IEEE standard 802.1Q and will support a number of VLAN?s (not less than 512).  The VLAN tag creates a virtual circuit across the Ethernet access network to map to the ATM subscriber PVC.  The MLA card will support a MAC address table with a minimum of 2000 MAC addresses.On/Off CAC (Connection Admission and Control)CAC allows Operators to oversubscribe the D50e with larger bandwidth connections than the D50e resources support.  Various traffic patterns make it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50e resources.  The general idea behind oversubscription is to overprovision the D50e with connections of combined total bandwidth larger than the D50e resources support.  The statistical nature of the traffic patterns makes it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50e resources.  This is a value add for Nokia customers especially if they are able to provision/control the oversubscription rate based on their subscriber intake rate and proportion of business to residential users. The CAC component in the call control module processes traffic descriptors and QoS performance requirements to accept/block a call dependent on available D50e resources in accordance with a predefined connection admission algorithm.LSM ATM QoS EnhancementsLSM enhancements in Release 10.0 include:?\tQuality of Service enhancements and improvement at the line shelf multiplexers.eMLAE1 Utilization AlarmProvisionalbe utilization alarms for eMLAE1 simil","LastUpdate":"2017-07-10T11:33:08Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-Mature Products","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P256465.07","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-000802","NSNPartner":null,"NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Oster Jukka","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2002-09-30T17:24:33Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2004-05-11T14:16:57Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2006-12-18T15:56:38Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2006-12-18T15:56:45Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2006-12-18T15:56:52Z","Obsolete":"2010-07-05T09:48:44Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-000803_","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"D50e R5.0","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-000803","NSNLegacyRevision":null,"NSNSummary":null,"LastUpdate":"2017-07-10T11:33:08Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-Mature Products","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P256465.01","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-000803","NSNPartner":null,"NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Oster Jukka","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2002-10-02T14:36:42Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2006-12-18T15:57:38Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2006-12-18T15:57:45Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2006-12-18T15:57:53Z","Obsolete":"2010-07-05T09:49:28Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-000804_","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"D50e R9.1","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-000804","NSNLegacyRevision":null,"NSNSummary":"R9.1 eSHDSL & SHDSL8  improvements","LastUpdate":"2017-07-10T11:33:08Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-Mature Products","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P256465.06","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-000804","NSNPartner":null,"NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Oster Jukka","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2002-09-30T17:24:34Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2004-05-11T14:17:07Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2006-12-18T15:58:33Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2006-12-18T15:58:40Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2006-12-18T15:58:47Z","Obsolete":"2010-07-05T09:50:08Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-000805_","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"METRO 5W C1.0-1","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-000805","NSNLegacyRevision":null,"NSNSummary":"Metro Site BTS #2 -

This card supports broadband AAL5/ATM segmentation, reassembly of ATM cells, and the PPPoE scheme both RFC 1483 bridged and routed, with VLAN?s (Virtual Local Area Network).  The MLA will support VLAN for LAN interconnecting or leased line customers per IEEE standard 802.1Q and will support a number of VLAN?s (not less than 512).  The VLAN tag creates a virtual circuit across the Ethernet access network to map to the ATM subscriber PVC.  The MLA card will support a MAC address table with a minimum of 2000 MAC addresses.On/Off CAC (Connection Admission and Control)CAC allows Operators to oversubscribe the D50e with larger bandwidth connections than the D50e resources support.  Various traffic patterns make it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50e resources.  The general idea behind oversubscription is to overprovision the D50e with connections of combined total bandwidth larger than the D50e resources support.  The statistical nature of the traffic patterns makes it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50e resources.  This is a value add for Nokia customers especially if they are able to provision/control the oversubscription rate based on their subscriber intake rate and proportion of business to residential users. The CAC component in the call control module processes traffic descriptors and QoS performance requirements to accept/block a call dependent on available D50e resources in accordance with a predefined

Various traffic patterns make it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50 resources.  The general idea behind oversubscription is to overprovision the D50 with connections of combined total bandwidth larger than the D50 resources support.  The statistical nature of the traffic patterns makes it feasible to use oversubscription and gain a high utilization of the D50 resources.  This is a value add for Nokia customers especially if they are able to provision/control the oversubscription rate based on their subscriber intake rate and proportion of business to residential users. The CAC component in the call control module processes traffic descriptors and QoS performance requirements to accept/block a call dependent on available D50 resources in accordance with a predefined connection admission algorithm.ATM/DS1ATM over DS1 is method for transmitting ATM cells using existing T1 lines.  Providing ATM over DS1 will allow features such as packetized voice to be transported over DS1 and onto an ATM network via the Nokia D50.MTU AlarmThe alarm notification from the MTU to the D50 will be added in Release 10.0.

In the MSS concept where only signalling is conveyed to MSS and both TDM and packet based user plane is transported via MGW, the CDS provides the IWF functionality for the CS data calls.The functions of the CDS depend on the services and the type of fixed network. The CDS is required to convert the protocols used in the PLMN to those used in the appropriate fixed network. The CDS is not used when the service implementation in the PLMN is directly compatible with that at the fixed network (e.g. 56/64 kbit/s transparent data services). To optimise the operator's IWF usage the CDS can be shared by several MGWs, which means that the operator does not need to aquire IWF resources to each MGW even though the access points for CS data calls are in different MGWs.","LastUpdate":"2017-07-12T12:39:06Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-3G Core","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P250673.06","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-004048.00","NSNPartner":"TietoEnator","NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Koskela Erkki","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2003-03-06T11:30:00Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2003-06-17T09:16:45Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2004-04-23T16:53:21Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2005-04-25T08:47:21Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2005-07-01T10:41:18Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2009-05-22T15:38:12Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2009-05-22T15:38:20Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2011-03-14T16:10:49Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2011-03-14T16:10:58Z","Obsolete":"2011-12-21T15:28:46Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-004073_00","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"Inspector 5.0 (old)","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-004073","NSNLegacyRevision":"00","NSNSummary":"Inspector is a Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring system for the management of IP based services in mobile operator and service provider environments.

The difference between the MSSu and an Integrated MSS is that the MSSu is a standalone server product dedicated only to control plane handling, whereas an Integrated MSS can also have TDM based control and userplane traffic.","LastUpdate":"2017-07-12T12:39:23Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-3G Core","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P262619.06","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-004898.00","NSNPartner":"TietoEnator","NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Koskela Erkki","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2003-06-05T10:00:28Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2003-06-17T09:17:10Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2004-04-23T16:53:41Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2005-04-25T08:47:38Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2005-07-01T10:42:21Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2011-02-07T10:58:24Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2011-02-07T10:58:33Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2011-02-07T10:58:41Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2011-11-07T13:26:17Z","Obsolete":"2011-11-07T13:26:26Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-004902_00","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"WSS releases","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-004902","NSNLegacyRevision":"00","NSNSummary":null,"LastUpdate":"2017-07-10T12:33:02Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-3G Core","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P256597.01","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-004902.00","NSNPartner":null,"NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Anttila Veli-Matti","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2003-05-19T11:00:07Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2003-05-19T11:00:22Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2004-02-13T15:37:58Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2004-02-13T15:39:29Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2004-02-13T15:40:18Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2009-05-12T09:29:58Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2009-05-12T09:30:13Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2009-05-22T12:45:24Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2009-05-22T12:45:40Z","Obsolete":"2009-05-22T12:45:56Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-004903_00","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"RSU releases on G1.2","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-004903","NSNLegacyRevision":"00","NSNSummary":null,"LastUpdate":"2017-07-12T12:39:14Z","NSNDesignResponsibility":"L-3G Core","NSNOriginalOwnerGroup":null,"Relation_Products_Code":null,"Relation_NSNMainProduct_Code":null,"Relation_Status_Products":false,"Relation_Status_NSNMainProduct":false,"NSNAliasName":null,"NSNCode":"P256529.01","NSNLegacyNcmCode":"133-004903.00","NSNPartner":"TietoEnator","NSNNameInCustomerNetwork":null,"NSNReleaseProductManager":"Eichler Carsten","ItemId":"","C1ReadyForProgram":"2003-05-19T11:26:22Z","C2ReadyForMarketing":"2003-05-19T11:26:43Z","C3ReadyForOffering":"2004-02-13T15:40:35Z","C4ReadyForOrdering":"2004-02-13T15:50:49Z","C5ReleaseAvailable":"2004-02-13T16:03:27Z","C6ReadyForRampdown":"2009-05-12T09:08:03Z","C7EndOfMarketing":"2009-05-12T09:08:16Z","C8EndOfOrdering":"2010-10-13T10:00:17Z","C9EndOfDeliveries":"2010-10-13T10:00:24Z","Obsolete":"2011-09-14T13:17:52Z","Rejected":null,"Implement":null,"Maintain":null,"Rampdown":null,"PDMModified":null,"PDMTimestamp":"2018-01-26T20:37:51Z","EDP_LastModifiedDate":"2018-05-21T03:13:33.7233333Z","EDP_ActiveStatus":true},{"Type":"NSN Release","Release_Id":"133-004904_00","ReleaseStatus":"inactive","Lifecyclestatus":"Obsolete","Description":"V3ED (old)","NSNParentClassification":"Product","NSNLegacyCode":"133-004904","NSNLegacyRevision":"00","NSNSummary":"NetAct for TETRA is the Nokia OSS solution TETRA networks.
