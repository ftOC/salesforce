    <defaultValue>&quot;We know the (assumed) budget and the drivers for the underlying TCO model. This is part of the customer`s stated business strategy/network plan and not an information gathering exercise. Our commercial offer (pricing and terms) is in line with customer`s expectations for this stage of the offer. The customer isnâ€™t requesting unusual terms or conditions which may be difficult to meet. We have strong relationships with the customer decision makers.&quot;</defaultValue>
