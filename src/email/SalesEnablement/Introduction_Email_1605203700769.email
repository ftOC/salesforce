<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I'd like to introduce myself as your resource here at {{{Sender.CompanyName}}}. I work with businesses in the <b>[software, healthcare, nonprofit, education, etc.]</b> industry, and noticed you visited our website in the past.<br />
<br />
This inspired me to spend a few minutes on <b>[Prospect's Company]</b> website to learn more about how you're approaching <b>[X strategy for customer service, sales, marketing, etc.]</b>. I noticed some areas of opportunity and decided to reach out to you directly.<br />
<br />
Nokia is working with similar companies in your industry, such as <b>[X Company Name]</b>, to help them accomplish <b>[Y goals]</b>, and giving them the <b>[Z tools/solutions]</b> to succeed.<br />
<br />
Do you have 15 minutes to discuss <b>[Prospect's Company]</b> this week?<br />
<br />
If so, you can book time directly onto my calendar here: <b>[Meetings Link]</b><br />
<br />
Looking forward to meeting,<br />
<br />
<br />
