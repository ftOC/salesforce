TCO analysis proves savings with private-hybrid clouds
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

We’ve talked about how moving to an enterprise cloud and network transformation are changing the enterprise game. However, I’m sure one of the questions at top of mind has been, “what will it all cost?”

Check out our white paper, “Moving from a legacy to a cloud environment &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/2210.Whats.your.TCO.for.moving.to.the.cloud.html.V2.html?did=d000000000aq&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 13b-tcoWP&amp;utm_term=finance]]&gt;,” to get answers to this and other Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) questions. It details how our IDC validated, TCO model was built and how flexible analysis can address different requirements and environments.

I hope that you enjoy this white paper!
