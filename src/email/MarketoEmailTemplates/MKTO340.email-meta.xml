A free online tool for calculating your PBX replacement business case
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I wanted to invite you to try our new online financial modeling tool that shows how you can replace your legacy PBXs with a cloud-based system within your current PBX maintenance budget.
Many enterprises are running an out-of-date communications infrastructure that doesn’t support modern communication and collaboration very well. As a result, all sorts of issues have affected the enterprise – from shadow IT to multiple siloed technologies.

What enterprises need to do is replace their legacy PBX infrastructure with a platform that enables customization, and optimizes for rapid technology change – all without exceeding the enterprise’s current PBX maintenance budget.

With our new online financial modeling tool, you can enter your own data to see the strong business case for replacing your legacy PBXs with a cloud-based system from Nokia.

Enjoy!
