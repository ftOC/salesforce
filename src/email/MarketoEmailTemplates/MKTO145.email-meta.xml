OpenStack private cloud – the right solution for the banking industry
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Does a private cloud make sense? That’s the question many large enterprises are asking. For the banking industry, the answer to that question is definitely - yes!

Read our case study, “Centuries Young Bank readies for another century of progress”, for details on how an OpenStack private cloud met the challenges of the banking industry and changed the game for this large multinational bank.

Sincerely,

Michael Williams | Global Enterprise Marketing | Nokia
