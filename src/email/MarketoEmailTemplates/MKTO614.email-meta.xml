Hello {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Your move to a cloud environment should improve operations and lower costs — especially hidden costs. 

Watch the video &quot;Why is cloud a vital topic for enterprises &lt;[[http://resources.nokia.com/asset/200885?did=d000000000at&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 3a-hybridcloudvideo&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt;?&quot; to discover how your legacy architecture is hindering your business and how an enterprise cloud from Nokia can not only expand your business options but also reduce TCO by a minimum of 25 percent!

I hope that you enjoy this video!
