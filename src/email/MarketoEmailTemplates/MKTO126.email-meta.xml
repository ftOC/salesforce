Webinar – IOT Connectivity:
 what are the benefits of a privately owned LTE network?
As a distribution system operator, you need to extend the reach of grid communications to fulfil your grid modernization and Internet of Things strategy - from distribution automation to substation automation, distributed generation and advanced metering infrastructure. Field area networks (FAN) can be enabled by a variety of communication technologies but this webinar will focus on long-term evolution (LTE). In the US, Nokia and AT&amp;T have joined forces to bring a private LTE solution which includes spectrum to the utility industry to allow power companies to build out a secure, converged FAN for critical distribution connections.
