Nokia launches its Third-Party Code of Conduct 2018
Nokia is pleased to announce the launch of its Commercial Third-Party Code of Conduct - a customized document to address the unique needs of our relationship with our commercial third parties. 

 As a third party doing business with Nokia, you play a critical role in our mutual success every day. In partnering with us, and in sharing your expertise, services, technical assistance, materials and goods, you are an integral part of a broader Nokia community that is working to fulfill the expectations of our customers.

 This Third Party Code of Conduct discusses Nokia’s expectations from our partners on the fundamental values, principles and standards of behavior, 
including, but not limited to:


	- Legal and Regulatory Compliance;
	- Ethical Business Practices;
	- Environmental and Social Regulations.


It also provides information on your responsibilities as a Nokia partner and gives information on how you can reach us in case of any questions or concerns.

 The Code of Conduct is available in eight languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Korean, Japanese, and Spanish). You can access these documents through the following link: https://www.nokia.com/en_int/investors/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct &lt;[[https://www.nokia.com/en_int/investors/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct]]&gt;

 Compliance with this Code of Conduct will be mandatory going forward for our commercial third parties entering into new 
agreements or renewal of existing agreements. 

 For any questions on Nokia’s Commercial Third-Party Code of Conduct or Nokia’s expectations from its commercial third parties, or if you become aware of any violation of attempted violation of relevant laws, this Code of Conduct or Nokia’s Code of Conduct, please contact your Nokia business representative and/or ethics@Nokia.com &lt;[[mailto:ethics@Nokia.com]]&gt;.

 You can also reach us through the following channels:
