Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},



Here is your free Current Analysis Market Update report to download &lt;[[#]]&gt; and share.



Current Analysis believes Nuage Networks has momentum in the SDN space



Nuage Networks, an Alcatel-Lucent venture, has demonstrated it has the right stuff to compete in the SD-WAN market. Our SD-WAN solution can significantly reduce operating costs and complexity while enhancing connectivity across the WAN.



We’re one of only three competitors that Current Analysis rates as “strong”! Our SD-WAN platform is tailored to the dynamic SDN environment. It runs on a variety of appliances, private and public cloud platforms, and can be easily extended to the branch office. With both hardware and software versions of our solution available, Current Analysis rates us “a solid fit for any scenario.”
