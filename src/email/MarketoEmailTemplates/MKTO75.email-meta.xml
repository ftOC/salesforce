Switch to Passive Optical LAN to cut costs and boost performance
How many times have you heard: better, faster, cheaper – you can have two but not all three. 

That’s not true with Passive Optical LAN. This next-generation local area network solution certainly brings better performance: up to 1 Gb/s to every occupant in a building. And its lightweight, flexible fiber optic cabling is definitely quicker to deploy than the copper cabling needed for a traditional LAN. 

But can it really be cheaper as well? 

You bet!
