Use cases based on multiple SUCCESSFUL cloud implementations
Hello Sir/Madam,

Develop a new cloud architecture by leveraging what others have learned through the process. 

Read the use case “Public-private cloud for financial services &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XT_Hybrid.Cloud.Financial.LP.html?did=d000000000aj&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 6b-hybridcloudforfinancialservicesusecase&amp;utm_term=finance]]&gt;” to learn how the Nokia overlay cloud solution has been successfully applied across multiple implementations and how you can:


	- Upgrade your large enterprise environment into a private cloud without needing a forklift
	- Provide access to public cloud as part of a hybrid cloud approach
	- Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by at least 25 percent!


I hope that you enjoy this use case!
