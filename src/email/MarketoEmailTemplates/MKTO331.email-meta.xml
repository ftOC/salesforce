Banks use OpenStack private clouds to transform operations
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Many banks are taking a wait-and-see approach with open source platforms such as OpenStack.

 Others have already implemented OpenStack private clouds for competitive advantage.

 So how did they succeed? 

 Our case study discusses how a major bank created a global private cloud that leverages OpenStack not only to unify their environment but also to improve security.
