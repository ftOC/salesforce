Discover our latest cybersecuity innovations
Network security systems are playing an increasingly significant role in protecting against emerging and complex cyber threats such as quantum computing. This is particularly critical as industries and governments are raising their attack surface with the digital transformation of their services.

At the FIC (23-24 January 2018, Lille, France) Nokia will showcase our latest innovations to protect mission- and business-critical networks:



	- A live demonstration of the industry’s only quantum-safe, ANSSI-certified, optical and microwave transmission solution
	- Industry’s first distributed, end-to-end (cloud, data center, branch) software-defined network security, visibility and security automation solution 

	- Our network-based solution to protect connected objects and secure massive deployment of new IoT-based services.
