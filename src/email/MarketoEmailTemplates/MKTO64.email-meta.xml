Bring your LAN up to light speed
Most local area networks in use today are based on 30-year old technology: Ethernet-over-copper. Sure, it’s managing to keep up – just – but not for much longer. As your organization grows, as you need more bandwidth and more complex services, the limitations of traditional LANs are harder to ignore.

Passive Optical LAN is the LAN for your future. It outperforms a traditional copper-based LAN everywhere you look:



	- Up to 50% lower CAPEX and OPEX.

	- Up to 1 Gb/s to every user.

	- Simplified operations with a single network for all services.

	- Military-grade security and carrier-grade reliability.

	- Liberate office space and reduce power consumption.

	- Scalable, flexible, and unlimited bandwidth potential.



Wherever you are in your plans for your LAN, Nokia Passive Optical LAN can improve them. Visit our website to learn more.
