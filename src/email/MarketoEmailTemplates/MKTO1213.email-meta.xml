Summary of planned changes to Associated Documents 


Partner Maintenance Agreements (NBoS and Co-Delivered Maintenance Service):
These stand-alone maintenance agreement templates were contemplated in any current PPA version 03_03 or earlier. They have been removed and replaced by two new associated documents: (i) 2019 Nokia Brand of Support Services Conditions &lt;https://www.partners.nokia.com/s/documentpage?Id=0692M00000KBbRbQAL&gt; and the (ii) 2019 Nokia Co-Delivered Maintenance 
Service Conditions. &lt;http://www.partners.nokia.com/s/documentpage?Id=0692M00000KBbHHQA1&gt; These new Associated Documents are applicable to any existing PPA as from the Effective Date of May 1, 2019. 

Partners having an existing PPA that includes the PPA-RES Partner Maintenance Conditions (03022018) - Legacy  &lt;http://www.partners.nokia.com/s/documentpage?Id=0692M00000KBbRgQAL&gt;are granted rights to continue use of existing discounts and quote offers based upon Maintenance Conditions 03022018 Pricing Rules until the earlier of (i) they 
renew their PPA and (ii) they enroll under the Co-Delivered Maintenance Service Conditions. 



	- External Assessments will not occur as a prerequisite to enroll


	- Partners instead will complete and submit a Services Checklist at time of seeking enrollment
	- Separate partner notification(s) will be addressed individually for any signed PMA (maintenance agreement) that were entered into.





Advanced Exchange Addenda will be replaced with unique Statements of Work at time of Maintenance Quotation to the Partner 




	- This change will improve the accuracy of the Service Level Agreement entered into between Nokia and the Partner – reflecting variances that exist on a country by country basis.
	- Advanced Exchange Service will be made optional on that basis in NBOS and Co-Delivered Maintenance Service Conditions.
	- Service Level tables previously published in this document will be transferred and updated regularly on the Partner Portal.




Data Protection Document for Maintenance Services 

Data protection regulations, in particular GDPR regulations, stipulate that when delivering support services to End-Customer, End-Customer personal data (e.g. end users’ personal information) must be protected. Nokia has developed a Data Protection document establishing the terms and conditions governing access and disclosure of any End-Customer personal data and how this has to be communicated and handled by all involved parties. This Data Protection document will be part of the Associated Documents and fully apply to delivery of any ordered Maintenance Service under any PPA in place at the date hereof which does not incorporate this Data Protection Document as exhibit to the PPA. 

Partner Program Rules: 




	- ART 5c. Naming Change from “Basic” and “Premium” Maintenance to “Co-Brand” and “Partner Brand” Maintenance providing clarification of partner role.
	- ART 6.5a. &amp;b. Accreditation Validity - removed forward rights prior to Accreditation and retired Accreditation grace periods.
	- Art 7.3 Partner Maintenance Services - the following clause will be removed:







	- “IMPORTANT NOTE: The provisions of this Program Rules applicable to Maintenance Services remain valid only until March 31st, 2018 and are applicable only to Partners who have signed Partner Program Agreement version 02_02 or earlier.”








	- and replaced as follows:


&quot;IMPORTANT NOTE: The new Co-Delivered Maintenance Service Conditions 01_01 published on Partner Portal apply only to Partners who have met the personnel Certification requirements and the process and tools Services Delivery Checklist of Requirements as recorded and submitted by your Nokia representative. They will supersede and replace Maintenance Conditions 03022018. 

However, Partners having an existing PPA benefiting from the Maintenance Conditions 03022018 will be granted rights to continue use of existing discounts and quote offers based upon Maintenance Conditions 03022018 Pricing Rules until the earlier of (i) they renew their PPA, and (ii) they enroll under the Co-Delivered Maintenance Service Conditions as mentioned above.” 





	- Art 10a. Changed the parties from “shall’ to “may” develop and measure quality Standards



Partner Maintenance Conditions: 



	- The following clause will be removed:


	- “IMPORTANT NOTE: These Maintenance Conditions are applicable only to Partners who have signed Partner Program Agreement – RES version 02_03 or earlier and will remain valid until termination of the Agreement. Nokia highly recommends all its existing Partners sign standard Partner Maintenance Agreements establishing conditions that provide a broader range of offerings and benefits for Partners.”






	- And replaced by:


	- o “IMPORTANT NOTE: These Maintenance Conditions are applicable only to Partners who have not still met the personnel Certification requirements and the process and tools Services Delivery Checklist of Requirements, as recorded and submitted by your Nokia representative, under the new Co-Delivered Maintenance Service Conditions and will remain valid until the earlier of (i) the renewal 
of their Agreement and (ii) the enrollment under the new Co-Delivered Maintenance Service Conditions according to the above.”








	- Newly parag. h. added to Section 2 to refer to the Data Protection Document to be posted on Partner Portal.






Glossary of Partner Program Terms:
