White Paper
Discover Agile Rules Technology (ART)
In a rapidly changing industry, you face many challenges that force you to react quickly to competitive threats and implement new business models, while further reducing operational complexity and cost. To address those challenges, you rely on telecoms software solutions. And along with databases and analytics engines, rules engines are a key element of many IT systems.

 In this white paper, learn about rules engine types, including general purpose rules engine, hard-coded rules engine, and Nokia’s Agile Rules Technology (ART) – software backed by over 150 patents, which allows you to easily write your own rules for 4G LTE’s Diameter signaling.
Enjoy!
