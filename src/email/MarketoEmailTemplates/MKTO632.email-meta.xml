Ethernet-over-copper LANs are on their way out. Time for Passive Optical LAN
Architects, construction companies and real estate developers around the world are changing in-building connectivity. Old Ethernet-over-copper LANs are on their way out. New Passive Optical LAN technology is on its way in. 

Passive Optical LAN solution uses fiber technology – the same that powers the internet – to deliver a host of benefits. 



	- Cost. Passive Optical LAN is up to 50% cheaper to install and operate than a traditional copper-based network. 

	- Performance. Passive Optical LAN delivers up to 1 Gb/s to every occupant in your smart building and has potentially unlimited scalability.
	- Longevity. Fiber optic cabling has a 50+ year lifespan. Install once and never touch it again. 

	- Energy. Passive Optical LAN consumes significantly less energy and helps meet building codes and environmental regulations. 

	- Space. Less equipment means valuable floorspace is no longer sacrificed for equipment rooms and closets.
