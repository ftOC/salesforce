It was great meeting you down under!
G’day Mates!

We had a blast meeting you in Sydney and showing you our latest advances in cloud operations. Now that we’re all back to our daily lives, we wanted to share a few more ideas about how you can use OpenStack services to automate fault management on the CloudBand cloud infrastructure.
Check out the OpenStack wikis to learn more:


	- Vitrage, the OpenStack Root Cause Analysis Service &lt;[[https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vitrage]]&gt;
	- Mistral, the OpenStack Workflow Service &lt;[[https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral]]&gt;


Join the conversation:


	- Attend Vitrage design meetings Wednesdays at 08:00 UTC at #openstack-meeting-4
