Making connections that bring real-time healthcare to life
With the healthcare industry using more digital technology and moving toward real-time care, providers are challenged to make the best use of data by providing it to the right person at the right time in the right format.

To accomplish this, healthcare organizations need an IT infrastructure that supports widespread digital transformation and a real-time healthcare system (RTHS) model.

Read our ebook, “Making connections that bring real-time healthcare to life &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/17872.HIMSS.Realtime.healthcare.eBook.LP.html]]&gt;” and learn more about cloud, Real-Time Healthcare System networks, the Internet of Medical Things, and remote patient care for your digital transformation.
Sincerely,

Cindy Bergevin
 Head of Healthcare Marketing, Nokia
