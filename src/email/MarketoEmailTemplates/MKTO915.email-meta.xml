Nokia’s Transportation, Energy and Public Sector (TEPS) lead speaks on our Enterprise TEPS strategy
The Enterprise Market is in a new disrupted state. Most organizations now recognize the power of digitization and the ability to significantly impact cost efficiencies (save money) and reinvent the economic model (make money). “Enterprise organizations are certainly at the stage where they are aware of the need to disrupt their own business practices or face disruption from their competition”. – Chris Johnson, Head of Global TEPS
