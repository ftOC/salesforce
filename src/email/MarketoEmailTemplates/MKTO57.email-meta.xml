The best ideas are better for everyone: open source webinar
October 25, 2017 - 2PM London | 9AM New York | 9PM Singapore

 
The way in which applications, networks, and services will be built in the future is changing rapidly. Openness is the key to success, and open source is an important part of that. However, just like proprietary software development, open source requires resources, investment, and leadership. 

In our webinar we will look at the benefits of open source, what it takes to be successful with this approach, and how Nokia is leveraging open source.
