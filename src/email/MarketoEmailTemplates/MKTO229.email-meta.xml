Universities of the future: passive optical LAN technology supports a new learning experience 
6 December, 12:00 PM EST

 
The local area network is the central nervous system of every successful organization. But today’s copper-based LANs rely on technology that is more than 30 years old. Universities are struggling with demands for higher speeds, improved security, lower energy consumption, and a need for upgrade every 3 – 5 years. It’s time for something new.

 
It’s time for Passive Optical LAN. 
Using POL technology, CallisonRTKL has worked with universities around the country to create integrated, reliable and scalable solutions that cut costs, conserve resources, and improve security. 

Discover from an IT manager how POL has changed construction and renovation at Amherst College and how it can make a difference to your university. 

Join Nokia, CallisonRTKL and guest speaker Steve Judycki from Amherst College on December 6 at 12pm EST to learn more about what Passive Optical LAN can do for you.
