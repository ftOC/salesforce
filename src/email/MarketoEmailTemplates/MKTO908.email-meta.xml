Webinar
Learn about deploying 4G LTE Diameter routing agents
Diameter signaling traffic in your 4G LTE network is poised to grow rapidly because of the emergence of new devices, machines and applications. As a result, you might find yourself facing some new challenges, including:


	- Increased signaling traffic volume
	- Greater topology complexity
	- Higher risk of internal and external threats to your network


Successfully overcoming the challenges will come down to three essential key elements – scalability, simplicity and security. In this Heavy Reading and Nokia webinar, find out how Diameter routing agents (DRAs) are evolving to manage control plane demands more effectively.
Enjoy!
