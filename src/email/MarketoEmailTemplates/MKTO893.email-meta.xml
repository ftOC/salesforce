Expert Diane Myers weighs in on migrating SBCs to the cloud
As voice networks increasingly become all-IP, the use of session border controllers (SBCs) for interconnection between service providers continues to expand.

 Paired with the growth of subscribers over IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) and the adoption of voice over LTE (VoLTE) and voice over WiFi (VoWiFi), it’s no surprise service providers are looking to migrate their SBCs to the cloud to improve both operational and cost efficiency.

 In the on-demand webinar and industry report, Diane Myers, Senior Research Director, IHS Markit, explores:


	- Challenges for SBCs associated with scalable VoIP and IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) networks
	- Key considerations for deploying SBC in a network function virtualization (NFV) environment
	- Lessons learned from real deployments of SBC in an NFV environment
	- The most critical features of software-only SBCs in NFV
Enjoy!
