Network Computing: How do enterprises evolve their communications infrastructure?
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Valued Customer}},

I thought you might be interested in my latest blog post on Network Computing to discover how enterprises can take advantage of an open, cloud-based platform and use it to modernize their communications infrastructure for the future.

When evaluating possible enterprise communications technology upgrades, enterprises tend to look at the cost first and foremost. However, the ultimate goal for any enterprise should not be to just replace existing infrastructure with something cheaper. What you really want to do is transform enterprise communications and collaboration for the future.

With an open, cloud-based communications platform, enterprises have the freedom to customize communications to specific department requirements, while optimizing for future technology change. The result is a solution that tightens business focus, and increases business agility.
Enjoy!
