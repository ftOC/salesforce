Enterprise Connect 2018
Nokia is launching the cloud-native SBC which allows you to:


	- Minimize costs by eliminating hardware-based SBCs
	- Secure your network against untrusted devices and DDoS attacks
	- Increase customer satisfaction with new WebRTC services


Our team will be at Enterprise Connect 2018 in Orlando from March 12-15 at booth #207 and we hope to see you there!
