How to architect for secure service enablement

	- Key market trends for VoLTE, IMS, roaming and service enablement
	- How to securely increase network performance, reliability and profitibality
	- How to gain agility for the future
	- Lessons for tier 2-4 operators to learn from tier 1 deployments
Enjoy!
