Accreditation deadline approaching
Second notice: Accreditation deadline: May 4, 2018

Dear Partner, 

I am writing to remind you again that the deadline of May 4, 2018 is approaching for you to meet all criteria towards accreditation at your targeted level. You will want to pay attention to this deadline if today your company enjoys any rights and entitlements afforded to you as a result of your Accreditation tier, such as pricing discounts.

As a reminder, Nokia requires any partner who was contracted under Nokia Partner program “GPP 3.0/PPA-RES” as of May 4, 2017, and who has committed to become accredited at the Advanced 
or Expert tier, to meet all accreditation criteria to fully achieve and/or maintain that accreditation tier. Detailed Program Rules relating to Accreditation may be found in Section 6.5b of the Partner Program Rules criteria for accreditation. A brief list of the requirements by tier and product can also be found below.

You may always find your current accreditation level by visiting your Account in the Nokia Partner Portal. Simply:

Log in &gt; Click on Accounts Tab &gt; Select Account Name &gt; Select Related Tab &gt; Scroll to your Accreditations Table.

 If you have any questions related to this upcoming deadline or your current accreditation status, please contact your Partner Sales Manager.

 Regards,

 Jerome Jullien
 Vice President, Nokia Global Partner Program
