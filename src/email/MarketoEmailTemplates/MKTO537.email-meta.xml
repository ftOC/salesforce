Use case reveals SUCCESSFUL implementations in financial services
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Move to implementation of your unification cloud with more knowledge based on what others have learned along the way. 

Read our use case “Unification cloud for financial services &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XT_Unification.Cloud.Financial.LP.html?did=d000000000am&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 9b-unificationcloudforfinancialservicesusecase&amp;utm_term=finance]]&gt;” and discover all the drawbacks you should avoid during the new architecture development process. It summarizes the solution functionality across multiple successful Nokia implementations and reveals how you can:


	- Unify and simplify even a large enterprise environment arising from mergers and acquisitions into a coherent cloud
	- Get mission-critical network control and security
	- Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by at least 25 percent!


I hope that you enjoy this use case!
