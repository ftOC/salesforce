PAC 2017
We missed you at the Nokia Partner Advisory Council in Rome

I and the Nokia team missed you in Rome, Italy for the 2017 EMEA Partner Advisory Council, where select partners shared valuable insights on the market and Nokia’s Global Partner Program and strategy. 

Our executive team firmly believes that the success of any partnership is based on trust and dialog. It is important for us to share with you the commitment and investment Nokia is making in the Channel Partner model. That includes a new Configure/Price/Quote tool, new IP, WiFi, and Optical Networks products, and focus on segments such as Smart Cities. Obviously, the conversations at the Partner Advisory Council are only the beginning. All of us at Nokia look forward to working with you and the rest of our partner community to continue to improve our overall partnership and to put into action the suggestions offered at the meeting. 

The presentations from the 2017 Partner Advisory Council are now available for download &lt;[[https://resources.ext.nokia.com/asset/201617]]&gt;. The password to access the file is: PAC2017.

 Thank you, and we look forward to continuing our dialog and following up with you on a quartely basis. 

Sincerely, 
Ismael Hassa 
Head of Partner Management, MEA
