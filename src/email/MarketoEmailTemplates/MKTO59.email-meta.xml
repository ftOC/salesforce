Bring your LAN up to light speed
Are you driving a 30-year old car? Relying on a 30-year old computer? A 30-year old mobile phone? Of course not. Slow. Unreliable. Costly and time-consuming to look after. 

Most local area networks in use today still run on 30-year old technology: Ethernet-over-copper. But the Nokia Passive Optical LAN promises a wealth of improvements for a fraction of the cost of a traditional LAN.

Too good to be true? 

No. It’s just natural progress. Passive Optical LAN harnesses the same fiber technology that powers the internet. It brings it into a LAN-sized solution at a business-friendly price. 

Find out how you can bring your LAN up to light speed with Passive Optical LAN to boost performance and cut costs for your organization.
