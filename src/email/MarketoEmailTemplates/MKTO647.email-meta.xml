As you plan the evolution of your broadband services, you need to make some important decisions:


	- What speeds do I need to deliver my customers?
	- How long can I wait before competitors start coming for them?
	- How much can I afford to invest?



FTTH is the ultimate broadband technology. But an FTTx option might serve you better in the short-term. How do you decide?

Listen to our webinar to learn about Nokia’s fiber-to-the-most-economical-point (FTT$) strategy. Our unique, technology-agnostic approach helps you find the right balance between cost, time-to-market, and service levels.
