PAC 2017
Thank you again for taking the time to participate at the Partner Advisory Council. 

As mentioned in Rome, we are conducting a small post-event survey that will help us improve these councils in the future. Please help us by filling out the last part of the survey at the below link. These four questions should only take a minute to answer.
We’ve also collected some sweet memories from the networking activity we participated in at the InRome Cooking School, including recipes and pictures. These are available for download &lt;[[https://resources.nokia.com/asset/201732]]&gt;. The password to access the file is: PAC2017.

Thank you again and we look forward to continuing our dialog soon. 

Sincerely, 

Andrea Újlaki 
Regional Partner Marketing Manager, EMEA
