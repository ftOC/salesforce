White paper: This is what a modern IP network looks like
A more responsive, secure and efficient, insight-driven IP network approach is here
Modern IP networks play a crucial role in bringing people, businesses and industries together in the digital world. They enable humans and machines to interact instantaneously, intuitively and securely, allowing new services and applications to flow – without constraints or concerns.

But there is an issue.

Increasing scale, connectivity, diversity and dynamics of cloud content and Internet of Things (IoT) applications are putting intense pressure on IP networking. All of this is driving the need for a new paradigm for designing and operating modern IP networks. We call it insight-driven automated networking.

In this white paper, you’ll gain valuable insights into:


	- The operational challenges posed by cloud and IoT
	- How to optimize delivery of cloud applications
	- A better way to mitigate distributed denial of service attacks
