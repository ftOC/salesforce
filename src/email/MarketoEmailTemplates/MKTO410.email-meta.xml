Migrating SBCs to the Cloud
A cloud-native vision for SBC

From our perspective, there are three key elements CSPs require if they are to achieve their virtualization, cloud, and network-evolution goals. Being able to meet these requirements is at the core of Nokia’s product technology strategy.

 The new Nokia Session Border Controller (SBC) for cloud is a prime example of what that strategy looks like in action.
Enjoy!
