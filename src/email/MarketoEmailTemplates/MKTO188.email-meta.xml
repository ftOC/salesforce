IBM/Nokia Demonstrate Live Event Analytics at Texas Rangers 
game









During a series of Texas Rangers Major League Baseball games inSeptember, IBM and Nokia analyzed fan activity using a solution called LiveEvent Analytics (LEA)). Incredible insights into fans preferences, behaviorsand interests were discovered during several exciting games. Do you know whatthe top 10 websites millennials browsed?...or where in the US or globally theRangers fans were from? These insights were presented to Texas Rangersexecutives, several sponsors, advertising agents and venue owners at a specialinvite only forum
The IBM and Nokia team were able to show how analytics candirectly lead to additional sponsorships opportunities or new engaging servicesthat can benefit their fans. For example, by understanding that many fans wereinterested in travel to the Caribbean and Mexico, the Rangers could targetthese customers with specific advertisements from key sponsors. Newdigital billboard space can also be built with a combination of IBM’s GBSapplications and Nokia’s Multi-access Edge Computing capabilities increasingrevenues for venue/rights owners.
Live Event Analytics is the key to opening up new revenuestreams for owners of stadiums, venues, airports, malls and smart cities. Byunderstanding your customers, residents and fans in a deeper way, you canmodify your services and applications to better serve them.

Nokia deploys datacenter interconnect solution with Thailand&apos;s 
INET









Nokia has provided its DCI solution for Internet Thailand Public Company Ltd. (INET), marking one of the first long-haul DCI solutions in the country. Nokia&apos;s Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) &lt;[[https://networks.nokia.com/large-enterprises/data-center-interconnect]]&gt; technology will connect INET&apos;s two datacenters in the capital city Bangkok to a site in Saraburi
In keeping with the trend of Big Data, where major global customers are expanding their data hosting plans, INET has seen its datacenter business grow significantly over the past few years. The ICT solutions provider invested in multiple datacenter sites to support this growing demand, necessitating massive data connection requirements between sites to keep customer data secured and managed, with a better total cost of ownership (TCO).
Nokia has deployed its DCI solution in conjunction with reseller Teohong Silom Co. Ltd., helping INET introduce multiple types of datacenter interfaces and data rates to existing and new customers, thus assuring a highly reliable network. The solution is based on the 1830 Photonic Service Switch (PSS) and managed by the Network Services Platform. The 1830 PSS is a high-performance Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) platform that delivers the capacity, security and control required for long-haul data center networks.

WIVE project uses 5G to increase the business value of automated transport, smart 
grids, massive machine connectivity and media delivery









An industry group led by Nokia Bell Labs and including several academics in Finland has established a collaboration project called WIVE (WIreless for VErticals) to make it possible for new types of industries to gain competitive advantage from the latest wireless technologies, especially 5G. The project, co-funded by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes), involves several industry, research institute and academic partners such as Nokia, Teleste, Telia, ABB, Cargotec Kalmar, Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle),Digita, regulator FICORA, key Finnish universities as well as VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.
WIVE aims to develop concepts and enable technologies, as well as to test and experiment new vertical services offered by 5G, especially for URLLC, mMTC, and media content delivery. These new communication services have versatile requirements for reliability, latency, data rates, security and availability. The WIVE project aims to demonstrate that these requirements can be fulfilled with future 5G networks with improved flexibility and cost-efficiency

Passive Optical LAN in healthcare and the need for proper networks in 
hospitals









The proliferation of medical and non-medical applications brings new challenges for the “business as usual” approach of IT implementation in healthcare facilities. The IT networks in these facilities are under increased pressure from patients, guests, physicians and devices, demanding advanced connectivity. The use cases are broad and extensive for healthcare facilities.
With so much “more” needed, it’s time for a network solution that is purpose-built to meet this demand. Passive Optical LAN (POL) is ideally suited for all types of healthcare facilities, from small clinics to specialty and large corporate hospitals. It allows healthcare facilities to achieve improved efficiency at lower cost, green buildings and more efficient spaces by providing a future-proof and high-speed infrastructure.

Nokia expands private wireless network portfolio to support enterprises in their digital transformation









Nokia is extending its portfolio of access and core technologies to support the digital transformation of industries and enterprises. New small cells, Wi-Fi® connectivity, Multi-access Edge Computing and Cloud Packet Core capabilities will allow businesses to manage and operate their own private wireless networks as they transform operations.
To enable a truly digital enterprise, businesses today require a layer of network connectivity based on mobile broadband technologies like LTE. These networks offer the high reliability, coverage and guaranteed low-latency needed for industrial applications such as factories, ports and mining operations to connect myriad assets and take advantage of capabilities such as asset tracking, automated workflows and advanced analytics.
New features on the industry-first Nokia will allow companies in the United States to leverage 3.5 GHz CBRS shared spectrum as it becomes available. These features offer compatibility with Spectrum Access Servers, which monitor and assign usage of available CBRS shared spectrum to ensure enterprises are using available spectrum in compliance with FCC regulations.
Nokia will also launch a virtualized Multi-access Edge Computing solution, making it possible for enterprises to run MEC over commercial off-the-shelf IT servers, easing integration with existing IT infrastructure in the process. MEC processes data closer to where it is generated, ensuring the network delivers the guaranteed low latency required by business-critical enterprise applications and for an interactive user experience in. By processing data locally, MEC applications can also significantly reduce data transfer costs.
A local breakout function in the virtualized MEC will allow operators to deliver private LTE networks to enterprises over their 4G network. Alternatively, the virtualized MEC is complemented by a range of Nokia virtual core solutions, providing greater flexibility for enterprises in the way they manage their own networks.
Wi-Fi® will continue to support non-critical office applications and Nokia is also offering companies greater flexibility in Wi-Fi performance and coverage with a new, compact, cost-efficient outdoor AirScale Wi-Fi Access Point.
Companies operating in remote locations could face additional challenges in terms of expanding their support of business-critical operations. Nokia is solving this challenge by enhancing the flexible multi-access Cloud Packet Core with a Hybrid Access Gateway capability. In addition to providing packet core functionality, this will allow mining, oil and gas and other industries, which operate private wireless networks, to seamlessly integrate multiple access technologies including licensed and unlicensed wireless, fixed and satellite, to deliver increased capacity and resilience and to extend mission-critical and collaborative services and applications to the 
required locations
