Smart building connectivity that frees space, costs and energy
Traditional in-building local area networks consume a lot of energy. The active components coupled with the necessary cooling equipment are a significant contributor to a property’s carbon footprint. 

But a new LAN solution called Passive Optical LAN has been proven to reduce energy consumption by up to 82%. What’s more, it also provides better performance than a traditional Ethernet-over-copper LAN, so you can keep your buildings green and your customers connected with the same technology that powers the Internet.
