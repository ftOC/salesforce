It was great meeting you in Los Angeles!
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Sir / Madam}},

It was great meeting you recently at the ONS event in Los Angeles and demonstrating our latest advances in cloud operations. We hope you had the opportunity to drop by our booth and learn more about CloudBand’s solutions for network operations transformation.


Now that we’re all back to our daily lives, we wanted to share a few more ideas on our involvement in various open source initiatives, as well as how you can use OpenStack services to automate fault management on the CloudBand cloud infrastructure, and much more.


Check out the OpenStack wikis to learn more:



	- Vitrage, the OpenStack Root Cause Analysis Service &lt;[[https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vitrage]]&gt; 
	- Mistral, the OpenStack Workflow Service &lt;[[https://docs.openstack.org/mistral/latest/]]&gt; 


And, if you didn’t have the chance to attend the keynote panel on the future of networking and the LNF with Ron Haberman, our VP of Emerging Products, here’s a link &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc9GtJPw0wk&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLbzoR-pLrL6qRtjoA5vHbU2YDma56KNG9&amp;t=0s]]&gt; for you to view.

We’re committed to building better projects together and look forward to collaborating with you.
