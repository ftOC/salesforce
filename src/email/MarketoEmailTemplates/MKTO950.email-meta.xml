Managing your own Private Optical Network
Want to build your own private network but not sure how to manage it? We have the answer.
Enterprises need a management system that will allow you to MANAGE:


	- Multi-vendor &amp; multi-domain software for complete fault, performance and inventory management.
	- A single-pane-of-glass provides a complete network wide view and consistent look and feel for managing all network elements.
	- Network discovery and change detection to provide real time and accurate network snapshot management systems.
	- Automated, node-specific analysis enables you to isolate trouble at the root cause.
	- Get live fault, topology, performance in a single common view with the Circuit Analysis Tool.
	- Easily pinpoint problems across your multi-vendor/multi-domain network with reporting and analysis.


Explore the one management system for all your needs by watching the next installment &lt;[[http://lightriver.nokia.pages.services/lightriver-nokia-campaign]]&gt; of the Nokia and LightRiver webinar series.
