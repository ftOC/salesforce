Migrating SBCs to the Cloud
Brochure: Virtualize and cloudify your Session Border Controller

 SBC is the cornerstone of all IP-communications voice, video and messaging services due to its strategic position at the edge of CSPs’ access and peering networks. As a result, this requires SBCs to constantly evolve, grow its feature list and execute new functions.

 Discover the Nokia Cloud SBC solution and understand how Nokia can help meet your requirements.
In this brochure, get a detailed overview of the Nokia Cloud SBC solution and how our SBC virtual network functions (VNFs) meet both the traditional and new requirements of today’s fixed, mobile, cable and converged networks. 

 Enjoy!
