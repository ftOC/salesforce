OpenStack changes the game for a global conglomerate
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

How do you “conglomerate” a private cloud? It’s not as complicated as it sounds. 

Read our case study &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/9908.Success.With.Shared.Private.Cloud.v2.html?did=d000000000au&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 4a-koreanpccasestudy&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt; to discover how an OpenStack private cloud solution changed the game for a South Korean global conglomerate. This complex organization, with many companies, is benefiting from a new approach to cloud hosting by:


	- Strengthening its position as a strategic service provider

	- Substantially raising its protection levels

	- Leveraging economies of scale.


I hope that you enjoy this case study!
