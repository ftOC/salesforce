Join this webinar to find out how AI and machine learning can advance your grid&apos;s security
13 June, 2019
14:00 London / 13:00 Paris / 15:00 Johannesburg / 9:00 New York
Having actionable information is key to mitigating your grid’s security risk, but focusing on specific details might prevent seeing the larger contextual view that can reveal additional dimensions of overall system vulnerability.
Automating more of your daily processes for managing and addressing regulation and compliance requirements (such as NERC/CIP or the NIS directive) is becoming an urgent need, and bringing the additional advantage of leveraging the growing amount of data to provide a holistic view.
Several factors are increasing the importance of assessing current processes and tools:


	- growing attack surface with extending communications to more devices in distribution
	- IT/OT convergence
	- growing number of recent fines for security lapses
	- more sophisticated longer developing advanced persistence threats


Tune in on Thursday June 13 to learn more on:
Creating a comprehensive, yet cost-effective approach to mitigating the security risk to utility networks through proactive, predictive and automated security using artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Find out how this leverages experience with helping operators secure networks with hundreds of millions of subscriber devices.
