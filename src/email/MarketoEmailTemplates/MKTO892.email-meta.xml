Nokia Technical Primer
Discover how to control signaling congestion and enable growth
Achieving network growth is a challenge when struggling with signaling congestion. With the move to 4G LTE comes rapid increases in signaling traffic and the growing complexity of interworking different versions or interpretations of 3GPP’s Diameter standards.

 At Nokia, we offer a way to help you solve these challenges, reduce the risk of signaling storms and provide security to your signaling network.

 In this technical primer, you’ll:


	- Learn technical details on Diameter signaling and Diameter routing agents (DRAs)
	- Read about the challenges encountered in 4G LTE deployments
	- Explore solutions, including mesh simplification, mediation within networks and secure roaming
Enjoy!
