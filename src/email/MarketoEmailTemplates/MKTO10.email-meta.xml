Passive Optical LAN cuts costs and boosts smart building connectivity
Choosing the right smart building connectivity technology can bring a welcome boost to the profitability of your brownfield or greenfield developments. Nokia has made it easy to calculate how much a switch to Passive Optical LAN could save you and your customers. 

Input some basic information about your property’s networking requirements – floors, end-points and cabling – into our LAN Savings Calculator and we’ll show you how much cheaper Passive Optical LAN is compared to a traditional Ethernet-over-copper LAN. 

What’s more, Passive Optical LAN liberates floorspace, 
reduces building loads and contributes to a greener, leaner development.
