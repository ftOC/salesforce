Join us in being Allwhere at EC 2019!
We are on the cusp of a new industrial revolution that promises to unlock massive economic and productivity gains and set us on course for a new era of tremendous transformation and progress! Industry 4.0 technologies — IoT, IoMT, edge computing, deep analytics based on artificial intelligence and machine learning, ubiquitous networking, augmented and virtual reality, and more — are here or very soon will be! Nokia calls this vision Allwhere.
Please join us at Enterprise Connect in Orlando, Florida, Booth 1227 from March 18-21 to see how Allwhere can help you transform your Enterprise.
Nokia will be discussing how our portfolio can help you reap the advantages of this revolution!
We will feature thought-provoking demonstrations that bring the Allwhere vision to reality including:


	- Delivering healthcare in real time
	- Leapfrogging voice security not only to best of breed but also to the cloud
	- Leveraging the latest computer technology advances to battle even the most sophisticated security threats using AI, machine learning and multi-dimensional analytics
	- Upgrading to an enterprise LAN that can support this vision.


Nokia’s own Kelsyn Rooks will also be part of a panel discussing “What You’ll Wish You Knew About 5G” on Thursday, March 21, from 9-10 AM.
We look forward to seeing you!
Nokia has full function demonstrations so you can see for yourself!
