White Paper
Answer the needs of the telecom industry by migrating SBCs to the cloud
Session border controllers (SBCs) are a network “must” for providing IP-voice, video and messaging services – by securing and controlling the signaling and media streams.

 With the growing number of IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) deployments and the move to voice over LTE (VoLTE) and voice over WiFi (VoWiFi), now is the time to move your physical SBCs to the cloud – especially if you want to reap the benefits of increased operational efficiency, cost efficiency and future agility. 

 In this whitepaper, you’ll learn about:


	- The main drivers for cloud SBCs
	- The challenges associated with migrating SBCs to the cloud
	- How to ensure optimal performance when virtualizing the media plane
Enjoy!
