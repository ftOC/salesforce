Accreditation deadline approaching
March 28, 2018

 Dear Partner, 

 I am emailing to remind you that the deadline of June 17, 2018 is approaching for your company to meet all criteria for Partner Program Product Accreditation at your current level. You will want to pay attention to this deadline if you wish to continue the rights and entitlements afforded to you as a result of your Program Accreditation tier, such as pricing discounts.

 As a reminder, Nokia requires any partner who was contracted under Nokia Distributor program PPA-DIS as of September 17, 2017, and who has committed to become Product Accredited at the Premier 
tier, to meet all the published criteria to fully achieve and/or maintain that Accreditation tier. Detailed Program Rules relating to Accreditation may be found in the Partner Portal in Sections 5.5 a and b of the Distributor Program Rules. A brief list of the requirements by tier and product can be found below.

 If you have any questions related to this upcoming deadline or your current accreditation status, please contact your Partner Sales Manager.

 Regards,

 Jerome Jullien
Vice President, Nokia Global Partner Program
