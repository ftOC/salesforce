Charting your path forward 3:00 – 3:55 pm
 Explore how to integrate machine learning, automation, augmented reality, IoT, and 5G into today’s multi-vendor communications network. Investigate how to do this in a way that securely enables innovation while transitioning communications to support a next gen utility with new business models.

 Private LTE Network 4:05 – 5:00 pm
 Investigate the different options for deploying it today and how these address key use cases driving this solution. Gain insight into how it’s ready for 5G.

 Both workshops are scheduled on Tuesday, May 8 at the Renaissance Palm Springs Hotel (adjacent to the convention center), in the Andreas room, and are exclusively for utility personnel.
