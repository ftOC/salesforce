Video: BT weighs in on Nokia and networking
British Telecom shares networking journey
Telecommunications giant BT is the UK’s largest mobile operator and provider of consumer fixed-line voice and broadband services. They’re also helping 12 million homes and businesses go “ultrafast” by 2020. You could say they have a lot going on.

To be successful at what they do, including providing the highest quality of experience, BT needs technology partners they can count on. One of the most important partners is Nokia, says Neil McRae, Managing Director and Chief Architect at BT.

At Nokia’s recent launch of the world’s first multi-terabit router, McRae took the center stage to share BT’s experience partnering with Nokia.


“Working with Nokia, over the past 10 years has been a pleasure in terms of rolling out their platforms.”



“Nokia has taken us on a journey of scaling our network and doing it in a way where reliability has been outstanding.”


Tune into this video replay from the June 14, 2017 event to hear about BT’s network technology journey, including where they’ve come from, where they are now, and what they have planned for the future.
