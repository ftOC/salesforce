OpenStack changes the game for a global conglomerate
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

How do you “conglomerate” a private cloud? It’s not as complicated as it sounds. 

Read our case study to discover how an OpenStack private cloud solution changed the game for a South Korean global conglomerate. This complex organization, with many companies, is benefiting from a new approach to cloud hosting by:
 

 	- Strengthening its position as a strategic service provider
 	- Substantially raising its protection levels
 	- Leveraging economies of scale.

Sincerely,

Michael Williams | Global Enterprise Marketing | Nokia
